# Language Exchange

## What is it?

The Language Exchange seeks to help people learn a foreign language by connecting them with a native speaker of the language they're learning. People are instantly connected with each other via video chat and instant messaging and can take turns practicing their foreign language.

The Language Exchange is an Angular webapp that uses icecomm.io (powered by WebRTC) for video chat and the Google Translate API for text chat.
